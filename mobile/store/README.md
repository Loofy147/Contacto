# Store Directory

This directory contains all the logic for our global state management, which is handled by **Redux Toolkit**. Redux Toolkit is the official, opinionated, "batteries-included" toolset for efficient Redux development.

## Core Concepts

-   **Store**: The single, centralized store that holds the entire state of the application. The store is created in `store.ts` using the `configureStore` function.

-   **Slices**: The state of the application is broken down into "slices," which are self-contained bundles of state, reducers, and actions. Each slice is responsible for a specific feature's state. For example, we might have a `userSlice` to manage the authenticated user's data and an `authSlice` to manage the authentication state. Slice files are located in the `slices/` subdirectory.

-   **Reducers**: Reducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action, and return the next state. In Redux Toolkit, we use the `createSlice` function, which automatically generates reducers based on the functions we provide. This allows us to write "mutating" logic in our reducers, as Immer is used under the hood to ensure immutability.

-   **Actions**: Actions are plain JavaScript objects that describe an event that has occurred in the application. With Redux Toolkit, actions are automatically generated by the `createSlice` function.

## Structure

-   **`store.ts`**: This is where the Redux store is configured and created. It combines all the reducers from the different slices and includes the middleware for RTK Query.

-   **`slices/`**: This subdirectory contains all the Redux slices for the application. For example:
    -   `authSlice.ts`: Manages the authentication state, such as the user's token and loading status.
    -   `userSlice.ts`: Manages the profile data of the currently authenticated user.
    -   `uiSlice.ts`: Manages the state of the UI, such as whether a modal is open or the current theme.

By using Redux Toolkit, we can manage our application's state in a predictable, organized, and scalable way.
