# 🌐 CONTACTO: PLATFORM-WIDE OPTIMIZATION ROADMAP
## Strategic Alignment & Technical Standards

**Date:** January 23, 2026
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Scope:** All Microservices & Frontend Applications

---

## 📊 OBJECTIVE
To apply the **7 Strategic Identities** across the entire Contacto ecosystem to ensure a unified, high-performance, and secure professional platform for the Algerian market.

---

## 🛠️ TECHNICAL STANDARDS (PLATFORM-WIDE)

### 1. Data Layer (Tuber 🔧)
- **Monitoring:** All services must use the standardized Prisma middleware to log queries exceeding 100ms.
- **Indexing:** Quarterly database audit to ensure all `WHERE` and `JOIN` clauses are indexed.
- **Partitioning:** Transactions and logs must use PostgreSQL table partitioning.

### 2. Performance (Bolt ⚡)
- **Caching:** Implement "Cache-Aside" with Redis for all GET endpoints with high read/write ratio.
- **Async:** Use Kafka for non-blocking operations (e.g., sending emails, indexing in search).
- **Frontend:** Next.js Server Components and partial prerendering for homepage and search.

### 3. Security (Sentinel 🛡️)
- **Middleware:** Unified `authenticate` middleware with token blacklisting.
- **Validation:** Strict Zod validation for all incoming request bodies and query parameters.
- **Logging:** Log all security-relevant events (failed logins, unauthorized attempts, role changes).

### 4. Architecture (Oracle 🔮)
- **Decoupling:** No direct database access between services. All communication via API Gateway or Kafka.
- **Idempotency:** All event consumers must be idempotent to handle retries safely.

### 5. UX & Consistency (Pallette 🎨)
- **Responses:** Standardized `{ success: true, message: string, data: any }` format.
- **Errors:** Standardized `{ success: false, error: { code: string, message: string } }` format.
- **Accessibility:** Frontend must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.
