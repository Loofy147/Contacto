# API Documentation & Developer Experience

Providing a world-class developer experience is a core goal for the Contacto API platform. Our success is tied to how easily and effectively developers can integrate with our services. This document outlines our strategy for API documentation, developer tools, and community support.

## **Developer Portal**

We will create a dedicated developer portal (`developers.contacto.dz`) that will serve as the central hub for all developer-related resources. The portal will include:

-   **Interactive API Documentation**:
    -   Built with **Swagger UI** or a similar tool (e.g., Redoc).
    -   Based on the **OpenAPI 3.0 specification**.
    -   Features a "Try-it-out" functionality for making live API calls.
    -   Includes automatically generated code samples in multiple languages (cURL, JavaScript, Python, PHP).
    -   Provides a downloadable **Postman Collection**.

-   **Getting Started Guide**:
    -   A step-by-step tutorial for authentication.
    -   A guide to making your first API call.
    -   Walkthroughs for common use cases (e.g., building a simple POS).
    -   A list of best practices for using the API.

-   **Comprehensive API Reference**:
    -   Detailed descriptions for every endpoint.
    -   Clear request and response schemas.
    -   A complete list of error codes and their meanings.
    -   Information on rate limits and how to handle them.

-   **SDKs & Libraries**:
    -   **JavaScript/TypeScript SDK**: For frontend and Node.js developers.
    -   **Python SDK**: For data analysis and backend integrations.
    -   **PHP SDK**: To cater to the local market where PHP is prevalent.
    -   **Mobile SDKs (React Native)**: To simplify integration with our mobile app.

-   **Tutorials & Guides**:
    -   In-depth articles and tutorials on topics like:
        -   Building a complete POS application.
        -   Integrating with e-commerce platforms (e.g., WooCommerce).
        -   Implementing and securing webhooks.
        -   Creating a custom analytics dashboard.

-   **API Status Page**:
    -   Real-time monitoring of API uptime.
    -   A history of past incidents.
    -   Announcements for planned maintenance.

-   **Developer Community**:
    -   A dedicated **forum or Discord server** for developers to ask questions and share solutions.
    -   A **GitHub organization** with example projects and open-source tools.
    -   A **technical blog** with articles on API updates, new features, and best practices.
